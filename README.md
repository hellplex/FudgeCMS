FudgeCMS is a JavaScript full-stack learning project, to build a web generator using the MEAN stack.

MEAN stands for:

- *M*ongoDB**. NoSQL Database (plus Mongoose for adding schemas and features to noSQL DB)
- **ExpressJS**. Node server framework, for routing and middleware 
- **AngularJS**. Front-end framework for building Single Page Application, (plus Boostrap for CSS)
- **Node.JS**. Server side evironment using JavaScript, based on Chrome's V8 engine

Other tools used include:

- **NPM**. Package manager
- **Bower**. Package manager
- **Karma**. Test runner
- **Github**. Version control
- *Countless dependencies*

FudgeCMS is built from scratch. No specific frameworks or boilerplates, such as Mean.io, or Mean.js were used on this project.

For that you can visit Fudge.io and Fudge.js, when they are ready, maybe.
